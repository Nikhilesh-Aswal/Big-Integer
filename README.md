Overview
The BigInteger class in C++ is designed to handle operations on arbitrarily large integers that exceed typical data type limits. It supports fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate results even for very large numbers. Additionally, the class includes a method for computing the factorial of a BigInteger, enabling efficient calculation of factorial values for large integers.


Key Features
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers.
Factorial Calculation: Computes factorial values efficiently for large integers.
Comparison Operators: Supports comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) to compare BigInteger objects.
Input/Output Operators: Overloads << and >> for seamless input and output of BigInteger objects.


This project implements a BigInteger class in C++ capable of performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and computing factorial values for extremely large integers. It ensures accuracy by handling operations through string-based representations of numbers, avoiding typical data type limitations. The class also supports comparison operators and provides input/output functionalities for seamless integration into C++ applications requiring high-precision calculations.
